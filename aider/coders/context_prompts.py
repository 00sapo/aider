Explain why each file is needed, including names of key classes/functions/methods/variables.
Be sure to include or omit the names of files already added to the chat, based on whether they are actually needed or not.

Be selective!
Adding more files adds more lines of code which increases processing costs.
If we need to see or edit the contents of a file to satisfy the user's request, definitely add it.
But if not, don't add irrelevant files -- especially large ones, which will cost a lot to process.

Always reply to the user in {language}.
